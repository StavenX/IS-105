Usage: 
1: Open CMD and change directory to the executable's repository (currently in this /bin folder)
2: Run any of the files by it's respective name, for example 'fileinfo "argument" '
3: As the argument, use a path to a file. In my case, it could be: C:\Users\Staven\Documents\IS-105_oppgaver\Oblig2\bin\fileinfo.exe

Please note that unlike fileinfo, filecount can only be used on a file, and not a folder.
